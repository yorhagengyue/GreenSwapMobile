# Onboarding Images

This directory contains images used in the onboarding screens of the GreenSwap app.

## Adding Images

To add a nature image for the onboarding screen:

1. Place your desired image in this directory
2. Name it `nature.jpg`
3. Make sure the image is high quality and represents nature/rivers/plants theme
4. Recommended resolution: 1080Ã—720 or similar 3:2 aspect ratio
5. Optimize the image for mobile (compress to reduce file size if needed)

For production, you should add proper attribution for any images used in your application.
