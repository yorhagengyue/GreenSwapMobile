# GreenSwap App Image Assets

To complete the app, you'll need to add the following image files to this directory:

1. `background.jpg` - A dark forest/tree background image
2. `leaf_character.png` - A green leaf mascot with a happy face and waving hand
3. `google_logo.png` - The Google logo for the sign-in button

If these images are not available, the app has fallback options:
- For the background, a solid color will be used
- For the leaf character, a green eco icon will be shown
- For the Google logo, a "G" icon will be displayed
